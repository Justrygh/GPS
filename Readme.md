//**********GPS Project!**********//

This project represent a GPS system in Object Oriented course in Ariel University.
In this project we work with 3D/2D Points in the Sphere (In our case the planet Earth).

We have been asked to do the following assigments:

1. represent a basic coordinate system including:
 * 1. The 3D vector between two (lat,lon, alt) points.
 * 2. Adding a 3D vector in meters to a global point.
 * 3. convert a 3D vector from meters to polar coordinates

2. Convert a given CSV file into KML file with the following details:
 * 1. Name 
 * 2. Ethernet (In our case it's WIFI)
 * 3. Date (Whenever the WIFI was first seen).
 * 4. Coordinates (lat, lon, alt)

3. Create a Data structure that will contain the following things:
 * 1. Create an Element that will contain the details above we mentioned and in addition will
      contain the Time Stamp (The time and date the element was created) and his color.
      // Each element in a row in the CSV file.

 * 2. Create a Layer that will contain all the Elements we created. While creating the layer
      we gave each layer a *UNIQE* color that all the elements inside the layer will have the 
      same color in order to notice the difference between each layer.
      // Each Layer is a CSV file.

 * 3. Create a Project that will contain all the Layer. Convert a folder with CSV files into
      One KML file containing all the details of the CSV files.

**In order to know what each class/function purpose is, I suggest you to look over at our JAVA DOC which explains everything into specific details.**
